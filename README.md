# Pokédex

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create an application that functions as a Pokédex. The application will have three main screens on a Tab bar: 
- Pokémon list
- Pokémon types
- Favorites.

## Pokémon list screen
This screen will display a list of all Pokémon in numerical order. The list will include the following data:
- Pokémon name
- Pokémon number

The screen will also include a search bar that will allow users to search by Pokémon name or number. When a user selects a Pokémon from the list, the Pokémon detail screen will open.

### Pokémon detail screen
This screen will display detailed information about the selected Pokémon. The information will include the following data:

- Pokémon image
- Pokémon name
- Pokémon number
- Pokédex information
- Pokémon types (You should be able to select a type and be redirected to the type's detail screen)
- Pokémon evolution chain (You should be able to select a Pokémon and be redirected to the Pokémon's detail screen)

## Pokémon types screen
This screen will display a Collection View with all Pokémon types. The list will include the following data:
- Pokémon type name
- Pokémon type symbol

When a type from the list is selected, the type detail screen will open.

### Type detail screen
This screen will display information in the table with sections about the selected type. The information will include the following data:
- Double damage dealt
- Double damage received
- Half damage dealt
- Half damage received
- Not affected by
- No effect against

## Favorites screen
This screen will display a list of Pokémon that the user has marked as favorites. The list will have the same format as the Pokémon list screen. When a Pokémon from the list is selected, the Pokémon detail screen will open. It is also necessary to allow the removal of a Pokémon from the favorites list. Store this information on the phone.
